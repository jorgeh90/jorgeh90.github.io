            <div class = "my_story">
                <p> As a kid I moved around quite often, but originally from San Diego, CA. I left hot and sunny San Diego for cold, snowy and beautiful Alaska, before moving back to Sacramento where I attended elementary school. It was in elementary school that I started to play every sport imaginable. However, I was more prone to do cartwheels in the outfield then catch a fly ball so I stopped all the "ball sports" and focused on gymnastics. It was through gymnastics that I learned that value of hard work and dedication. Gymnastics was not easy for me and I learned that if I did not give 200% effort I would not learn the new tricks and be able to progress to competing. When I was 13, my father, a Lawyer, accepted a job at the United States Embassy in Riga, Latvia and my family moved East. It was a great two years of my life and in Latvia I continued my gymnastics training under the head coach of Latvia, Arturs Mickevics.  He was a great mentor and coach and helped  me learn that key to success is about having a solid foundation and focusing on the basics.  For 3 months all we did were handstands for 2 hours a day. At the end of the 3 months I could do a handstand longer than I ever dreamed. I could hold a one minute handstand on the floor and 10 second handstand on the rings (if anyone reading this has attempted to do a handstand on the rings you will know how hard this truly is !)  This goes to show the power of practice and focus.</p>

                <p> If you really want to change your body, you can but it will take hours of focus, concentration, and developing positive habits (like practicing and going to the gym) to enforce your health and fitness goals. When I was in 10th grade, my family moved again. This time from  Eastern Europe to Holland. I continued competing in gymnastics and placed 7th place in the Dutch Junior National Championships.  In High School I also played on the school volleyball team, swim team and was also a cheerleader. You can say I have always been active and I think that important to be as active as possible. Find your gymnastics and going to the gym will be as easy as doing something you love! In college, I stopped competing in gymnastics and started working coaching gymnastics and personal training. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2012. While in College I attended the sea-based study abroad program Semester at Sea, and studied for a semester in Prague, Czech Republic. I  continue to have a passion for travel and have been to 50 countries.</p>
