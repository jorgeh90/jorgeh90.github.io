            "This man knows how to inspire, motivate, listen, be attentive, and PUSH you to reach your goals.  I'm completely grateful for Greg as a trainer. I went from a 16% body fat percentage to a 12.4%, and I've gained more definition while maintaining my weight at 180lbs. He has boosted my confidence at the gym, and has taught me how to step out of my comfort zone in my workouts (being flexible enough to change your routine at the gym is an especially important skill during 'rush hour' times). I can sincerely attribute my reignited dedication and knowledge about fitness to Greg's training."</p> <span class = "name">- Brian P. (Los Angeles)</span>﻿

            "Greg has been training me for over two years. He has a great physique himself which is inspirational and lends him credibility. He is reliable, sensitive to my needs, and always finds ways to improve my routines. Great sense of humor, too. I couldn't find a better trainer at any price."</p> <span class = "name">- Gary M.

            "I trained with Greg for the first time recently and I gotta say, you cannot go wrong with this guy.  I actually work in the fitness industry and I know alot of trainings and their techniques.  Greg strikes the perfect balance between being a militant personality-free "do this, do that" type trainer and a workout buddy.  If you want someone that's not going to BS you, and give you common sense advice for YOUR body, this is your trainer.  At the same time, he's fun to be around, cracks jokes, and just has one of those magnetic personalities that makes you feel like you've been friends for awhile.  For my first training session he showed me a variety of techniques and exercises and I cannot wait to do my next session with him.  Highly recommend this guy!"</p> <span class = "name">- Brent W.

            "I highly recommended Greg's personal training. I've had personal trainers in the past, some for not so reasonable prices, who are all about attitude and image. Instead, Greg's training style is very flexible, positive, and accommodating. He strikes the right balance between pushing you to new limits but also not being cruel or excessive. Additionally, his rates are extremely reasonable, which is boosted by the fact that he is willing to travel throughout LA. Finally, he is very punctual about being on time, responds to messages quickly, and is available as a resource on his own time via email. It is clear he does this not solely for money or image but rather to fulfill a genuine interest in health and fitness. Quite the refreshing change in a city of flaky, self-absorbed trainers!"</p> <span class = "name"> -﻿ Mike C. (Los Angeles)</span>

            "I got in touch with Greg last January after studying abroad for 6 months with absolutely no steady workout routine. I felt that I needed something to help me get back on track. I went through yelp and found Greg. He was perfect for what I wanted.  I saw Greg weekly leading up to Coachella 2014. We worked really hard on my entire body. He kept me motivated and entertained during our workouts. I always looked forward to our sessions. Over the 3 months my body and mind transformed. In the end I gained about 15lbs in muscle and lost 10lbs. in fat. After Coachella I continued to see him regularly until I eventually moved to SF. Every time I'm back down in LA I make sure to squeeze a few sessions in. They really make a difference in my motivation and form - plus it's nice to catch up. I highly recommend Greg if you're looking for a fun and determined trainer. He wants you to succeeded and reach your fitness goals as much as you do."</p> <span class = "name" >- Louis (Pasadena)</span>

            "I hadn't worked out with a trainer in a few years, and Greg was exactly the right choice for me to get back in the game. His training style (laid back, yet serious about the workout) and personality (easy to chat with about almost anything) were just what I needed to motivate me to hit the gym on a regular basis. I saw results quickly.  He's always on time and is very flexible. Easy on eyes as well. I highly recommend him!"</p>

            "Greg is such a wonderful personal trainer! I am a dancer and was looking to work out with someone who could give me exercises that worked with my body. What I loved most during our sessions is that he was so informative about every exercise we were doing and what part of the body was being used.He was so easy to schedule with and was always very flexible with getting together. He kept me on track and made sure to check in on how I was progressing, even outside of our sessions. Greg is so kind and such a wonderful person, I highly recommend him!"</p>

            "Greg is awesome.  He really engages with you and genuinely cares about your progress.  He also offers services where he tracks your diet and exercise in the myfitnesspal iPhone app, which helps a lot with motivation and staying on track. I've had physical trainers in the past that I didn't feel inclined to return to on a regular basis.... But Greg broke that mold and now I schedule sessions with him twice a week.Other trainers also taught me how to do things wrong.  Greg corrected my form and showed me how to do weight lifting properly.  Man I could really feel the burn and realized I had been doing it wrong for so many years. He's also really funny."</p><span class ="name">- Rick (Santa Monica)</span>

            "Greg is a great fitness trainer. I've worked with a few trainers before but Greg is the only one I feel like can contact and ask advice on diet tips or an exercise even when we are not working out that day.  He's easy to work with and always on time. His rates are very reasonable and what I like most is that he challenges you.  I highly recommend Greg as a personal trainer for both people who have never worked out before or for someone who is looking for a new routine or fresh ideas for their work out.Highly recommend Greg's small group class. It's always the perfect size. Greg has the ability to set up a challenging circuit for everyone to do at their own strength and pace. While he trains the group as a whole he also steps in and goes one on one with each individual adjusting your movements so that you get the most out of each exercise. If you're new to working out or just want a fun but challenging group experience- go take Greg's class."</p><span class = "name">- Jason (North Hollywood)</span>

            "Greg is very professional and is willing to go an extra mile for his clients to achieve their dream bodies. When I first met Greg, I was overweight, had a poor diet, and continued to gain weight. However, after training with Greg, I was able to break my bad habits and started to lose weight. After training with him for two months.. I lost about 15 pounds and more importantly gained muscle. (Something I never had before). When training with Greg, not only will he teach you new exercises, he will give great advice on nutrition and keep you highly motivated. If you are willing to do your own part, you will be able to achieve your goal. I highly recommend training with Greg and his rates are very reasonable."</p><span class = "name">- Ren (UCLA Student)</span>

            "Greg has been my personal trainer for the last 18 months. I appreciate that he tailors his approach to the specific goals of his clients. I train for muscular development and my friend who also trains with Greg is training for weight loss. He uses different approaches for both of us. In my case, I'm already quite muscular so he pushes me really hard which is exactly what I'm looking for. He also fits in core training and stretching into our sessions, both of which are weaknesses of mine. Greg is also personable and very funny. I've never worked out before with such an entertaining person (trainer or buddy). He obviously practices what he preaches as he himself has a muscular body and six-pack."</p>

            "Seriously, if you want see results, you have to hire Greg. I've been meandering in gyms for years not understanding the basics of weight lifting and finally someone who really knows what he is doing, broke it down. I'm telling you - I suck at gyms. Greg really takes his time with you and he really gives you a positive and pragmatic way of getting done what you think is impossible. I repeat...I hate gyms. But Greg is a first class trainer that make even the most pessimistic  client (me!) a true believer. He's the best in the game. You wont regret the investment and your jaded friends will be jealous.
